Rust is a system-level programming language, memory and is designed to ensure thread safety and prevent mistakes. As a system-level programming language, its basic philosophy is "zero-overhead abstract." In theory, its speed and C / C ++ sibling.

Rust can be classified as general-purpose, multi-pan type, compiled programming language like C or C ++. This two programming languages ​​are, Rust is designed to be thread safe. It supports purely functional, procedural orders, object-oriented coding style.

Rust target programming language is to create a highly secure and concurrent software systems. It emphasizes security, concurrency, and memory control. Although Rust borrowed C and C ++ syntax, it does not allow a null pointer and dangling pointer, both the C and C ++ system crashes, memory leaks and the root causes of unsafe code.

Rust has general control structures such as if else statements and loops for and while the. And C and C ++ style programming language, the code segment in curly brackets.

Rust that implement (implementation), characteristic (trait) and structured types (structured type) instead of class (class). This point, and inheritance-based OO language C ++, Java there is a considerable difference. And with Ocaml, Haskell functional language such closer.

Rust did the memory security without .NET and Java programming language for automatic garbage collector overhead, which is through ownership / borrowing mechanism, life cycle, and the type of system to achieve.

Here is an example of a snippet of the classic Hello World application:

Fn  main () {
  the println ! ( "Hello, World" ) ; 
}
Rust affects the popular programming languages ​​including C, C ++, C #, Erlang, Haskell, OCaml, Ruby, Scheme, and Swift and the like. Rust also affected the C # 7, Elm, Idris, Swift.

Rust provides a setup program, you only need to run from the official website to download and install the program on the appropriate Caozuoxitong. Installer supports Windows, Mac and Linux (via script) 32-bit and 64-bit CPU architecture on for Apache License 2.0 or MIT Licenses.

Rust runs on the following Caozuojitong: Linux, OS X, Windows, FreeBSD, Android, iOS.

Brief mention of the history of Rust. Rust was first Mozilla employee Graydon Hoare's a personal project, starting in 2009, received support from Mozilla Institute, announced the project in 2010. Between 2010 to 2011 to achieve the bootstrap. Since then, Rust has undergone dramatic changes in the design and repeated (course extremely hard), finally released version 1.0 in May 15, 2015. In this development process, Rust built a strong vibrant community, formed a complete set of stable project contribution mechanism (which is really scary). Rust Rust now by the project developer community ( https://github.com/rust-lang/rust maintenance).

Since 1.0 was released on May 15, the emergence of a large number of outstanding items (you can find on github search Rust), large companies are increasingly active participation Rust application development, as well as the open source community feedback.

The book (RustPrimer) aims to provide a proper Chinese Rustaceans beginners, the latest, to understand Chinese tutorial. This book would have been perfect follow up, never stops.

This book is the result of the entire Chinese community Gongtongnuli of Rust. Wherein, Rustacean involved in the book writing and revision are (in alphabetical order):

Wait. In this, our respect and thanks to their hard work and dedication!

I wish with Rust Happy programming!
